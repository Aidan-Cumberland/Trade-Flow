These files contain Machine Learning models that analyze and predict off of AI generated datasets
The first is a structure in Google Colab to work with a small dataset of 50,000
The second was worked on in a JupyterLab environment using the Google Cloud Platform to perform Machine Learning a big dataset 
(which could not be provided here due to size limitations)
The Colab only works with the small and the Jupyter works with big and small datasets.
